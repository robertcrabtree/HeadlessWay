        The ups and downs of life where you find life going on, above that bottom line of yours… go on regardless of whether they are resented, or just tolerated, or in the end (whether by God’s good grace, or simple looking-to-see, or both) welcomed with open arms. The art of handling these inexorable goings-on is the art of resting on what underlies them, the art and science of consciously being the ground which supports all that commotion without itself becoming disturbed in the slightest. Here, you are the bedrock of the world, where it all begins and where it all ends. Eternally one and the same, you are the Unmoved Mover. Douglas Harding, Head Off Stress.

        Are we face-to-face, in symmetrical relationship, object confronting object, each shutting out the other? Quite the contrary. Here where I am is no face, no speck of anything to ward you off with, to resist your invasion. Whether I like it or not, I’m so wide open to you that your face is mine and I have no other. Douglas Harding, Look For Yourself.

        If we really look at what it’s like where we are, surely we can see we are built for loving, we are built open, we are built as capacity for the other one, the loved one - or the one who is perhaps not consciously loved so much. We disappear in his or her favour, not because we are very nice or very loving people really but because that is the way we are, to vanish in favour of that one there. Douglas Harding. DVD: On Having No Head.

        I find in me two wills, one that belongs to the pre-mortem life of the one in my mirror, and the other which belongs to the post-mortem life of the one this side of my mirror. The former is quick to say NO! to a good half of what happens to me, while the latter eventually says YES! – SO BE IT! – to it all. And does so with good reason: I see that right here all my resistance is dissolved and I’m burst wide open to receive whatever’s in store for me. Saying Yes! to it is often excruciatingly difficult, of course, but it turns out to be the recipe for the only peace worth having. And so at last the paradox holds: it’s because I have no will that my will is done. Right here, total impotence and total omnipotence come to the same thing. Douglas Harding, To Be And Not To Be.

        Absence is for acceptance as absence, not as the presence of a well- concealed gold-mine. The gold comes out all right, but unsought, in its own good time and unpredictable shape. Douglas Harding, The Science of the 1st Person.

        When you start living the heroic life – that is, living from your true Nature – your peripheral and human nature is bound to benefit. You cannot know in advance how or when, but you can count on Yourself the superhuman hero giving yourself the human non-hero a helping hand and a leg up where necessary. Douglas Harding, Head Off Stress.

        It would be difficult to overstate the practical importance of this discovery, its consequences for everyday living. All alienation, all separation, the many-sided threat of hostile things and persons and situations – these are no more than bad dreams. All is You. How could you fear Yourself? How could you despise, resent, be bored by Yourself? How could you not love Yourself? Douglas Harding, Look For Yourself.

        Again we come to the great question, Who or What am I in my own experience? Am I a thing consumed with fear and anxiety and soon to perish and be forgotten, or am I the No-thing which includes things of different life-spans, from galaxies to particles and people? Things come and go within my Space, which is not the kind of thing that comes and goes. And therefore I am not frightened, I am not scared out of my wits, if I really live from Who I am and What I am which is my No-thingness, which is absolutely safe. Incomparable Safety is at your Centre, I suggest, Incomparable Safety. Because No-thing is absolutely safe. The aware No-thing where you are is not the kind of thing that can be destroyed. Douglas Harding. DVD: On Having No Head.

        Yet it’s no bad thing to be fearful, provided we’re driven to the one refuge from all danger and stress and fear – to this incomparable Safety, to the Place or No-place we have all along been at. By pointing a finger – or simply looking at What we’re looking out of at this moment, or by any other means that works for us – let’s get Home to What we are. Let’s stay with and live from this absolutely safe Reality instead of that accident-prone appearance in our mirror, and see what comes of it, what happens to our stress. Douglas Harding, Head Off Stress.

        So it all comes back to the crucial question of my true Identity. If I insist on making an object and a thing and a 3rd person of myself here, I am consumed with a thousand fears and better off dead. But if I give up this unrealistic and unrewarding habit and come to Myself, I see that I have never emerged from that marvellous Abyss, that before Abraham was I am, before the first galaxy and the first atom, before time itself. Right here and now, in the very place all this stormy weather of time and change come from, I am Home and dry. Where can I go from this Safe Haven? Douglas Harding, The Science of the 1st Person.

        What a relief to be backed by the One whose name is I AM, the name that precedes and introduces every other name. What a relief to merge into and be upheld by the Unlimited. Douglas Harding, The Trial of the Man who said he was God.

        This meditation is safe, not only because it can’t be bungled, not only because it avoids dependence upon others on the one hand and self-pride on the other, but also because it is uncontrived. There’s nothing arbitrary or fanciful about it, nothing to strain your credulity, nothing to go wrong, nothing to set you apart from ordinary people, nothing special. It is safe because it is finding out how matters stand, not trying to manipulate them. What could be less dangerous than ceasing to deceive yourself about your Self, or more dangerous than not doing so? Douglas Harding, quoted in Seeing Who You Really Are by Richard Lang.

        The spirituality that denies the universally accepted findings of modern science at all levels, or refuses to face up to them and cheerfully take them on board, is a pathetic and moribund travesty of spirituality. And conversely, the spirituality that perceives in these findings a rich and precious and indeed divine revelation of our time and for our time and just what's needed to treat our sorry condition, is alive and kicking.

        For thousands of years the wise have been siding with God and taking this way Home; and recommending, with all the eloquence at their command, this royal road from human bondage back to divine freedom. Now, at last, instead of being told about it by experts, we are being shown it. We are invited to see our own way through to God's own country. The Clear Country we're coming from and returning to.

        What I find difficult and unacceptable really, is the wishy-washy reliance on words, on concepts, of so much alleged spirituality. True spirituality is real, down to earth, concrete - it’s coming home from your appearance to your reality. As the Buddha said, you won’t by going reach that place where there is the end of suffering. You’ll get it by coming. We are so good at looking that way, and lousy at looking this way.

        Oddly enough, it’s the man who attends only to the outer scene, ignoring what lies at its Centre, who is more or less blind to that scene. For the world is a curious phenomenon that, like a faint star, can be clearly observed only when it isn’t directly looked at. The world will hide its true face from us until we look in the opposite direction, catching sight of it in the mirror of the Self. Douglas Harding, Look For Yourself.

    <node type="pointer">
        When two-way looking is persisted in, the external world is much more truly and vividly seen than when it is viewed by itself and as if it were the whole story, as if it were unobserved. It must be added, nevertheless, that even this enlightened way of looking at the world doesn’t begin to perfect one’s knowledge of the world, whose very nature is that it can only be inspected piecemeal and never comprehensively. Only its Source is given all-at-once and can be viewed unselectively, with complete objectivity. Douglas Harding, The Science of the 1st Person.

        The ‘as is’ world, the world as given before I start mucking about with it, for the purpose of controlling it, for the purpose of getting power over others, and so forth, the world as given to me when I am simple enough to dare to look at what is presented, I say, in my experience, that world is woven of blessings. It is a world full of blessing. It is a world built to a fabulously beautiful design. Douglas Harding. DVD: Melbourne Lecture.

        Besides the countless particular miracles that we comprise, there is that supreme irregularity – the fact that anything exists at all. Most unnaturally, there is not just Nothing. How adroit of It to happen! How deserving of our congratulations It is, for having arranged its quite impossible existence! After that, what are a few billion universes more or less? What impossibilities may not It or He have up His sleeve? And what may I not be in Him? Douglas Harding, The Hierarchy of Heaven and Earth.

        Ultimately sex doesn't come into its own till it is revealed as an aspect of the One's own joy in discovering and reuniting with Itself, disguised as the not-self or other - as one very special other. Douglas Harding, quoted in Seeing Who You Really Are by Richard Lang.

        I’m not saying, mind you, that a life consciously lived from its true Centre will be safe or painless, easy or consistently joyful. Real adventure is made of sterner stuff. Those great arms embrace the suffering of the world no less than its splendour and its thrill. Those hands know the torment of crucifixion. Only so can the terrible pain of the world be overcome. The real joy, the joy that casts no shadow and knows no variation, has come through the fire. Douglas Harding, To Be And Not To Be.

        My mirror confirms this wide-openness right here where I am. The very thing which long ago put a face on me now relieves me of it. Now I look in the glass to see what I’m not like! Douglas Harding, quoted in Seeing Who You Really Are by Richard Lang.

        The more steadily I gaze at the One that’s nearest and clearest, the more it turns out to be the dearest, more me than myself, the Resource that never really lets me down.

        I find that it is when my attention is centred primarily upon the One who is attending here, and only incidentally upon the world that confronts me, that the world is made marvellous in me. Then the great surprise, the most astounding fact of all, isn't what the Cosmos is but that it is; not the infinitely varied products there but their simple Origin here. Nevertheless when they are seen as proceeding from This they take on its wonder, and nothing is ordinary any more. Douglas Harding, The Science of the 1st Person.
