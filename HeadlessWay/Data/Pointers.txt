Notice your single eye!
The world is dancing in your stillness.
Every face is your own.
Is there a dividing line between your thoughts and the world? Isn't your mind at large?
Many voices, yet only one speaker, one listener.
See what is arising in this space now! Flowing from this mysterious nothingness.
You are not in the world, the world is in you. Freedom!
No boundaries! All is within you. All is you.
Point your finger at the place you are looking out of and look! How simple and direct is that!
Is there a dividing line between your body sensations and the world?
This moment, all of it, is flowing from the Source - from who you really are.
Problem there - the source of the problem here, and the source of the solution.
Next time you drink or eat, see where the food or drink go!
No distance! All is within you.
This spaciousness is always available - here and now. Isn't it?
Here we are one, forever.
You are busted wide-open for others - built for loving.
In every direction, the world fades out into THIS.
Seeing who you are is non-verbal. Everyone describes it differently.
Stress there to no stress here!
Perfect seeing, here and now.
If you want to be Yourself and no longer a shadow of Yourself, if you want to be Real, you must break the habit of continually leaping out of yourself in the effort to see yourself from out there as others see you, and cultivate the habit of sitting at Home and seeing yourself as you see yourself. Douglas Harding, Look For Yourself
Look down at yourself, at your own Neckline, and you'll see with unmatched clarity the Place where what you look like flips over into What you really, really are. And where You as Root start to quicken and burgeon and blossom and bear fruit as the world itself, eternally. Douglas Harding, The Trial of the Man who said he was God.
God is indivisible. This is so marvellous because it means the whole of God is where you are – not your little bit of God, but the whole of God. If we resist this, it’s because we are resisting our splendour, our greatness. The wonderful proposition of all the mystics that I know and would care to call real mystics is that the heart of you, the reality of your life, the reality of your being, your real self is the whole of God – not a little bit of that fire but the whole fire. Douglas Harding, Face to No-Face.
When people say they don’t see it they generally mean they don’t feel it: the inner landscape leaves them cold. But of course it does! Thank God for that. This is a matter of fact and not of feeling, of one’s eternal and natureless Nature and not of the ever-changing kaleidoscope of thoughts and emotions it gives rise to. It’s the truth that sets us free – the Truth that couldn’t be more plain – plain in the sense of cool and undecorated, and plain in the sense of unhidden. Douglas Harding, The Little Book of Life and Death.
This immense and self-aware emptiness that I find here isn’t just empty. It’s empty-for-filling. Ultimately no-one and nothing is left out. In fact I’m not well, not quite sane, not ‘all there’, not whole till I’m the Whole. Douglas Harding, To Be And Not To Be.
Till you see What you are you don’t know what obviousness is! Only you – the real You, you as you are for you, intrinsically – are absolutely visible. All else is more or less veiled. Compared with this Sight all other sights are obscure, fuzzy, groping, dim. There’s something unique about its obviousness, a sharpness, a surprise, a quiet thrill or frisson that there’s no proper word for. Douglas Harding, The Experience and the Meaning
